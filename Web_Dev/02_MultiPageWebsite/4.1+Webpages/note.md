# Multipage Website
## Multipage Websites: 
Need multiple pages(more coding files) in the project folder 

## Solution
1. We can use the anchor tag with relative path to refer to different pages inside the project folder.
2. There’s also an ‘asset’ folder inside the project folder and the image folder should be inside the asset folder
3. Also can Create a 'public' folder to store other pages than the main page
