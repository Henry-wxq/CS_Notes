"""
1) When we want to express more detailed compound types when defining the
function, we need to import the typing module
    a) List[T]: a list whose elements are all type t
    b) Dict[T1, T2]: a dictionary whose key are of type T1 and whose values are
    of type T2
    c) Tuple[T1, T2]: a tuple whose first element has type t1, second element
    has type t2
    e.g. the nested list [[1, 2, 3], [-2]] has type: List[List[int]]

2) Four Advanced Types(also imported from the typing module)
    a) Any: when we want to specify that the type of a value could be anything
    b) Union: when we want to express in a type annotation that a value could be
    one of two different types
    c) Optional: when we want to say a value could be a certain type, or None
        ยง Optional[T] = Union[T, None]
    d) Callable: when we wnat to express that the type of a parameter, return
    value, or instance attribute is itself a function
        ยง Takes two expressions in square brackets
        ยง first: a list of types, representing the types of the function's
        arguments
        ยง second: its return type
        e.g. Callable[[int, str], bool]: a type expression for a function that
        takes two arguments, an integer and a string, and returns a boolean.
