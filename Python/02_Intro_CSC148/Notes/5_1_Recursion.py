"""
1) Situation
    a) We couldn't write nested_sum with just nested loops. Instead, we solved
    it using recursion (a function that calls it self)

2) Definition of nested list:
    a) an int
    b) a list of nested lists

3) Partial Tracing & Fully Tracing
    a) Partial Tracing: trace without diving into the code, focus on the result
    b) Fully Tracing: Dive into the code
