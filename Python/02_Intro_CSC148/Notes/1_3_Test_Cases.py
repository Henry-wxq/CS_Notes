2) Multiple inputs:
    a) relationships between the inputs
        e.g. which one is larger

3) Property-based test:
    a) the type of the output
        e.g. "the function str should always return a string"
    b) allowed values of the output
        e.g. "the function len should always return an integer that is greater
        than or equal to zero"
    c) relationships between the input and output:
        e.g. "the function max(x, y) should return sth that is greater than or
        equal to both x and y"
