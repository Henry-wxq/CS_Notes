The addition problem was introduced in [the LSTM paper](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf) as a way to test whether an RNN could propagate information across many time steps. In the addition problem, the model is given a sequence of 2D vectors in the format:\n","\n","| Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 | Pos 4 | ... | ... | ... | ... |  ... |  ... |\n","|-----|------|-----|-----|------|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n","| 0.5 | -0.7 | 0.3 | 0.1 | -0.2 | ... | -0.5 | 0.9 | ... | 0.8 | 0.2 |\n","| 0   |   0  |  1  |  0  |   0  |     |   0  |  1  |     |  0  |  0  |\n","\n","The first dimension of each vector in the sequence is a random number between 0 and 1. The second dimension is 0 for all entries of the sequence except for 2 of the entries, where it is 1. The goal of the addition problem is to output the sum of the values in the first dimension at the two indices where the second dimension is 1. In the example above, the target would be 0.9 + 0.3 = 1.2. Below is a code snippet that generates a sequence and its target for the addition problem.\n","\n","The dataset may contain sequences of different lenghts, i.e. one example could have 50 items while another could have only 10. Tensors should have coherent shapes, i.e. each sample should have the same number of items. Your first task is to implement the `collate_fn` where you will append `PAD_ID` to the shorter sequences so that each sequence will appear the same length. Later when you are implementing the model, you will ignore these indices so that the function is computed only on the actual elements of the sequence.\n","\n","You can read more about how PyTorch's dataloader processes samples [here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7bfff84f","metadata":{"id":"7bfff84f"},"outputs":[],"source":["## don't change the following code\n","\n","PADDING_ID = 100\n","NUM_SAMPLES = 1000\n","MAX_SEQ_LEN = 50\n","\n","\n","def generate_sequence_problem(\n","    sequence_length: int = 50,\n","    k: int = 2,\n","    problem_type: Literal[\"add\", \"multiply\", \"mask\"] = \"add\",\n",") -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Generate a k-way sequence problem.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        sequence_length: Length of the sequence\n","        k: Number of positions to mark (default 2)\n","        problem_type: 'add', 'multiply', or 'average'\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        sequence: tensor of shape (sequence_length, 2)\n","        target: scalar tensor with the target value\n","\n","    The sequence has:\n","    - First dimension: random values in [-1, 1]\n","    - Second dimension: 0 everywhere except k positions marked with 1\n","\n","    Targets:\n","    - 'add': sum of marked values\n","    - 'multiply': product of marked values\n","    - 'average': mean of marked values\n","    \"\"\"\n","    sequence = np.zeros((sequence_length, 2))\n","    ## Randomly sample the numbers in the input sequence\n","    sequence[:, 0] = np.random.uniform(-1, 1, sequence_length)\n","\n","    random_indices = np.random.choice(sequence_length, size=k, replace=False)\n","    sequence[random_indices, 1] = 1\n","\n","    marked_values = sequence[random_indices, 0]\n","\n","    if problem_type == \"add\":\n","        target = marked_values.sum()\n","    elif problem_type == \"multiply\":\n","        target = marked_values.prod()\n","    elif problem_type == \"average\":\n","        target = marked_values.mean()\n","    else:\n","        raise ValueError(f\"Unknown problem_type: {problem_type}\")\n","\n","    return torch.tensor(sequence, dtype=torch.float32), torch.tensor(\n","        [target], dtype=torch.float32\n","    )\n","\n","\n","class SequenceData(Dataset):\n","    def __init__(\n","        self,\n","        num_samples: int = NUM_SAMPLES,\n","        max_seq_len: int = MAX_SEQ_LEN,\n","        padding_id: int = PADDING_ID,\n","        k: int = 2,\n","        problem_type: Literal[\"add\", \"multiply\", \"average\"] = \"add\",\n","        variable_len: bool = False,\n","    ) -> None:\n","        \"\"\"\n","\n","        Args:\n","            k: Number of positions to mark\n","            variable_len: If True, generate sequences of random length between k and max_seq_len\n","        \"\"\"\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.padding_id = padding_id\n","        self.k = k\n","        self.max_seq_len = max_seq_len\n","        data = [\n","            generate_sequence_problem(\n","                sequence_length=random.randint(k, MAX_SEQ_LEN)\n","                if variable_len\n","                else max_seq_len,\n","                k=k,\n","                problem_type=problem_type,\n","            )\n","            for _ in range(num_samples)\n","        ]\n","        self.X = [d[0] for d in data]\n","        self.y = [d[1] for d in data]\n","\n","    def __getitem__(self, index):\n","        item = {\n","            \"inputs\": self.X[index],\n","            \"targets\": self.y[index],\n","        }\n","        return item\n","\n","    def __len__(self):\n","        return len(self.X)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"cb3f1cf5","metadata":{"id":"cb3f1cf5"},"outputs":[],"source":["def collate_fn(batch: List[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]):\n","    targets = None\n","    inputs = None\n","    attention_mask = None\n","    ##########################################\n","    ## 0.5 points\n","    ## TODO: 1.
