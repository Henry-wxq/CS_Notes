Complete the step_network() function below. As you train, check whether your model can reach 90%+ accuracy within 500 steps (it should given the random seed provided, if every operation is implemented correctly). Once the training is complete, you can visualize the convergence by running the visualize_convergence() function below."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"af675600","metadata":{"id":"af675600"},"outputs":[],"source":["#################### DO NOT MODIFY ####################\n","\n","def visualize_convergence(model, X, y):\n","\n","    h = 0.25\n","    x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1\n","    y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1\n","    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, h),\n","                        np.arange(y_min, y_max, h))\n","    Xmesh = np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()]\n","\n","    model_inputs = Node(value=Xmesh.T)\n","    out = model(model_inputs)\n","    out.forward()\n","    pred = np.argmax(out.value, axis=0)\n","\n","    Z = np.where(pred > 0, 1, -1).astype(int)\n","    Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)\n","\n","    fig = plt.figure()\n","    plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, levels=[-1,0,2],alpha=0.8, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)\n","    plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=40, cmap=plt.cm.coolwarm)\n","    plt.xlim(xx.min(), xx.max())\n","    plt.ylim(yy.min(), yy.max())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ea69ba86","metadata":{"id":"ea69ba86"},"outputs":[],"source":["#################### DO NOT MODIFY ####################\n","X, y = make_moons(n_samples=100, noise=0.1)\n","y = y*2 - 1 # make y be -1 or 1\n","plt.figure(figsize=(5,5))\n","plt.scatter(X[:,0], X[:,1], c=y, s=20, cmap='jet')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d6d7b3c2","metadata":{"id":"d6d7b3c2"},"outputs":[],"source":["#################### DO NOT MODIFY ####################\n","model = LinearMLP([2, 16, 2]) # 2 layer MLP\n","X_node = get_node(name='X', value=X.T, op=None, parents=[])\n","y_onehot = OneHotEncoder().fit_transform(y.reshape(-1,1)).toarray()\n","y_node = get_node(name='y', value=y_onehot.T, op=None, parents=[])\n","\n","# Before training\n","layer_output = model(X_node)\n","loss = get_node(name='loss', op=SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss(), parents=[layer_output, y_node])\n","loss.forward()\n","loss.backward()\n","\n","print(loss.value)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8f0544d6","metadata":{"id":"8f0544d6"},"outputs":[],"source":["def step_network(network, inputs, targets, learning_rate):\n","\n","    #################### YOUR CODE ############################\n","    # TODO: Complete the training code using the Node() class,\n","    #       and operations (if needed) we built earlier.\n","    #       This function should return the loss from that step.\n","    #       Hint: refer to the week2 homework code to implement\n","    #             a new version of the step_network using the Node\n","    #             and Operations we built\n","    return 0\n","    ##########################################################\n","\n","def train_linear_mlp(mlp, learning_rate, n_iterations, inputs, targets):\n","    losses = []\n","    acc = []\n","    for _ in range(n_iterations):\n","        loss = step_network(mlp, inputs, targets, learning_rate)\n","        losses.append(loss)\n","\n","    return losses"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"3cb8f988","metadata":{"id":"3cb8f988"},"outputs":[],"source":["############### SANITY CHECK ###############\n","SEED = 123\n","np.random.seed(SEED)\n","\n","model = LinearMLP([2, 16, 2]) # one layer MLP, input_dim=2, hidden_dim=16, output_dim=2\n","X_node = get_node(name='X', value=X.T, op=None, parents=[])\n","y_onehot = OneHotEncoder().fit_transform(y.reshape(-1,1)).toarray()\n","y_node = get_node(name='y', value=y_onehot.T, op=None, parents=[])\n","losses = train_linear_mlp(model, 0.2, 500, X_node, y_node)\n","\n","# accuracy on the train set\n","out = model(X_node)\n","out.forward()\n","\n","print(\"Accuracy: \", (np.argmax(out.value, axis=0) == ((y > 0) * 1)).mean())\n","visualize_convergence(model, X, y)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1IYYC-A-V4Ugey5_5qHDAkoZLZdnWe1_a","timestamp":1761950735484}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"dataid_env2","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.11"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
