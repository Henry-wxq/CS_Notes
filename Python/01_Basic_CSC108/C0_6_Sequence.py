1) Immutable Sequences: str, range, tuple
2) Mutable Sequences:
3) Basic operations that can be applied on all sequences: (x, t are sequences, x is a variable)
    a) x in s
    b) x not in s
    c) s + t (range doesn't suppose addition and multiplication)
    d) s[i]
    e) s[i:j]
    f) s[i:j:k]
    g) len(s)
    h) min(s)
    i) max(s)
    j) s.index(x)
    k) s.count(x)
