2. Expressions: Expressions only contain identifiers, literals and operators,
   where operators include arithmetic and boolean operators, the function call
   operator () the subscription operator [] and similar, and can be reduced to
   some kind of "value", which can be any Python object.
    e.g. 3 + 5
         map(lambda x: x*x, range(10))
         [a.x for a in some_iterable]
         yield 7

3. Statements: Statements are everything that can make up a line
   (or several lines) of Python code. Note that expressions are statements as well.
